# Alzheimer_GAN
Generate additional images of Alzhiemer MRI's using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This is a project for COSC 424/525-Deep Learning. It is created by Josh Bridges, Heather Haynie, and Richard Gaddis.

AlzheimersGAN.ipynb - contains the code for the GAN
Classifier.ipynb - contains the code for the classifier

This code operates under the assumption that the Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset is located in the same directory as the notebooks, specifically in a google drive directory.
